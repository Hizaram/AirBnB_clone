## AirBnB Project

# Description
This is the a lite clone of the AirBnb web application, an online
accomodation rental platform. At this stage, we're building a
console that abstracts some processes which creates instances.

Our project specifies classes for User, Review, City, Amenity,
Place and State that all inherits from a superclass BaseModel. Instances are
serialized and written into a JSON file which can be reloaded and deserialized back into
instances.

# Requirement
Our project is written using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
